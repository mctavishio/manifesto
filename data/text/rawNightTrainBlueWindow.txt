day
last
passenger
last
bird
decades before there were
clouds of birds
tunnels of birds
forests ablaze with birds
then
one
then
none
swept by
a silver scythe
an empty swing
a wild &
twisted
flight
last
passenger
pigeon
she
slipped
away
forever
into sky
through
iron bars
into blue
ghost wings

the repairman repair(*) repair(z) rider passenger hero (ze)ro lone bird
the repair(z) => hero zero rider x
the rider flew
through an
open window into a
blue pool of light
s/he harbored at the nearest
railroad station &
took the night train
hot summer 1914
restless humidity /
season of rain

a bird could easily find
passage
it was just a matter of
unfolding a map
worn by dust & decades
creased in a junkyard chevy
tomb
glass was thicker
roads wound slower &
iron had more
weight
mail made its way from
town to town

sun soaked the landscape
rains fell against
tin dark nights
city lamps were
dimmer &
shadows
were deeper
a wild electricity
slipped silver across
naked wires
static expectation
the horizon bustled with
gleaming factories

forget the bullets
shouting towards heaven
& black clouds of wings
raining death
forget about orange fire
ravaging hundreds of forest
miles
thank the ax for
rows of houses
saluting the day

there is a blue window
on this train
one map one clock
one lamp one bird
a passenger rider repair(*) repair(z) hero (ze)ro
lone bird
clutching a worn brown
suitcase with claw & wing
can you hear the lonesome
whistle? call of wind
mouth harp & gentle beast
friend of night
coal whisky grain
homeless ghost
wandering shadow
on this train to glory
one car carries arms
one car carries soldiers
one car carries coal
one car carries grain
one car carries
... look away dear reader
one car carries live stock
brown frightened eyes
look away once more
out the window

fix your eyes upon the tracks
silver shining
ribbons of moon
the sun bends her rays
around this
rough cut orbit
glancing off our moon => our only moon
to dimly stain the night
even now the sun
reaches us with
her lamp her veils
her tenderness glimmers
before morning arrives
to this map this dawn

the mail train
the london midland scottish
railway
or iowa nebraska chicago
new york

our train moves forward
destinations west or south

the black glass window
flashes silver
time /
a map

wings & beak
fur muscle & hooves
from icy cliffs &
shifting tides
losing you
slipping grip
from this blue globe
this broken circle
fins & bulk
whale or reef
grasslands gone
forests torched & split

falling
a bird but fallen
broken suitcase
broken bottles
reeds for lips
night train hurtling
forward

cincinnati / ohio
the blue zoo
last stop
last motel
last call
last station
on the silver rail line
texaco dreams
this is the stop
this is the time
five till midnight
lamps aglow
the bell tolls
the oily pools
parched deserts
silent oceans
birdless skies
& your red eyes
brown
suitcase
torn shoes
coughing bird
whisky bird

the rider woke

not september
not cincinnati
not caged
not iron bars or
black black oily seas
forests tall as canyons
not september
not that passenger
alone
in her cage
singing to
late night
hollow echo concrete echo
this iron horse rides
past carnivals &
bowling alleys
texaco signs &
bars
industry!
past sleepy towns & drive in
pictures
life aglow
shiny metal coins
& watches

books of green stamps &
toasters
silverware &
pretty red glasses
green rimmed plates
pretty circles
pretty lines
& diners
the horse pulled in
to rest
& the rider found a table at a
diner near the station
near the five & dime
near woolworth's pretty bell
the door opened on bells
a sandwich &
steaming coffee
a soda &
piece of pie
red red cherry
pie
& glass windows
christmas lights & dolls
not december
but august afternoon

lazy sun
sweltering noon day
sun & glass windows
gathering heat
glory heat
asphalt heat
& the rider
at the center
of the reflection
in radiant heat
the center of all
light
a mirror
a pocket full of mirrors
to hold the heat
black heat
mercury rising
the rider rising
blazing opal eyes
cloaked in radiance
soaked in
radiance
fire
rushing down streets
at dawn

at midnight
the rider gathers their
blue coat
& flies
all aboard
no sandwich hurry aboard
swing up onto
the platform
iron chariot
rolling fire
wheels & fire
not september

dreaming
with sandwiches

broken down
streetlamps
broken light
cold nights
sandwiches
& dumpsters
manifestos & blankets

stolen maps
brown paper bags
& white receipts holding
black rows of numbers
blue patches of light
loose change &
crumpled bills or
gleaming mountains of green
golden houses built on
acres of green
rivers of black
asphalt between
a bird
would fly far from here
but the rider was
a traveler
a passenger
a resident of this iron box
this iron speed
a passenger of forward
motion
forward eyes
hurtling motion
next station
next silver dawn

next sun twisting
planet bending
light
or howl
tight beaked
glowing eyes
relentless forward
iron momentum
a book
on gravity
a window
down
it was the rider's plan
to pull it down
& by downward falling
to turn the motion
backward
to that day
to introduce
a window
towards sky
slate heavens
& passage

a 3rd possibility
a forever
august
a large round
still clock
in ecstatic suspension
arms flung wide
across the golden
sun
shadow angels
falling
hymns
a table of sandwiches
red drinks
& steaming
cups of
coffee
vending machines
sky blue
& nickels
spilling across
the floor
the rider could see
this 3rd possibility
a vision or
formula

in chalk on
slate
or bound
in leather
books
illuminated
red & gold
black black ink
an angel
falling backward
bisecting time
lancing wrong
turns
stitching extinctions
back to fabrics
replacing maps
back towards before
that day of
shadow birds
a pen lit
drawing
the train
a memory of metal
iron black
lonely singer

night & red & coal
velocity & weight
relentless hammer
chest
& weight
eyes & pitch
black ink & rain
twisting tracks
racing mass
gleaming night
lamp
stealing past
yellow silos
grain & coal
or lonely eyes
gaunt rider
wool fraying against
he night
the dirt dark floor
the track & heat
a glow
an iron beast
a roar
here on this old
platform

left behind
on splintered
floor dark & lonely
lampless floor
on a platform a
bird clutches a
suitcase with broken
clasp
dusty lungs
taste of far away
dusty sky
or the train
unbound
in its belly
gaunt figure
dark crow
night blanket
relentless motion
black steed
train of night
train of iron
train of fire
the horse the grain
the coal the fire
the dawn

unstoppable unmerciful
unending velocity
blue iron
mass & holy speed
night rider
grain
commerce
palettes of steel
lumber broken trees
yellow pupils
black cavern
red flames
thunder
god of storms
silver messenger
god of fire
welder of earth & sky
electric sky
the sky was falling
in glassy shards of
blue & steel
soot & rain
cold night
winter of atoms
wings turned to vapor

hearts turned to stone
desert eyes
shadow humans
chalky outlines
burned into concrete
formulas lining books
inky extinctions
the whimper of gone
last breath
downward curve
a population dynamic
& finally last bird
last flight
last wings
last breath
hymnless night
shadowless sun
merciless trajectories
heartless calculations
empty cage
rip tide & storm
or ghostly hollow noon
still noon
arid noon
white heat &

absence
a hole in the sky
small planet
small circle
oily seas
coal clouds
last transmissions
majestic refineries
nevada plumes
atomic silos
jet streams
metallic giants
gleaming glass
white lines
asphalt tides
but long before that
the passenger alone
& night train
iron tracks
armaments & cigarettes
voyage of goods
orange agents of fire
transport commerce
iron waves
relentless tides

rising
body counts
rapid heartbeat
extinction's pulse
trashcan symphonies
vacancy
empty lots
or endless
high rise
concrete &
broken glass
twisted steel
dynamite cyclones
but long before that
the rider &
different maps
different trains
faraway night
last stand
texaco
paths
chance
infinite between & time
light harp in 4 walls
light hymns

light color pitch
sound
depth or time
plastic commerce
& neon bibles
litanies
sacrifice & risk
broken hymns
near sighted crow
turn the clock
bend the metal
throw the switch
slam the lever
traversals
migrations
no line falling
digits in flight
letters numbers
electrical wires
radio waves
wireless traffic
electron rush
epic flying movies
traveling through air
invisible waves

people talking
through air
heavy clouds
information super highways
electron prophets
but long before
silicon chips
the race of numbers
the rider's chipped black beak
tattered red shirt
blackened boots
& worn brown suitcase
brown parcel
traveling home
another map
creased & stained
other trains
other nights
lonely crowds
guards on duty
sentinels
barbed wire
& prison gates
but before elevator
resurrections

asphalt meadows
atomic roulette
& broken webs
shattered webs
before guns
last retort
the passenger riding
riding home
or last bird
dreaming
blue blue window
floods & sirens
night rider
last dream
& her

the moth
captive of fire
