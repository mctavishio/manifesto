artist statement

ecologies
as a media composer and installation artist i create chance-infused open systems my work explores the porous intimate boundaries between humans and machines i blend sound data text code and abstract layered moving images code is a literature ::: a pattern language ::: a score it is a choreography ::: a performance a code renderer is the weaver ::: the mill ::: the alchemist ::: the wizard code is a spell ::: an incantation ::: an intent.

i have a background in cello performance mathematics ecology music theory and code the confluence of these disciplines informs my work as a composer and multimedia artist as both a musician and a mathematician i use multi-threaded dynamical systems and chance-infused emergent patterns as a queer artist i am interested in the infinite bendable between ::: the erotic dynamics of tapping glass ::: the carbon cycle ::: the fragile electric cyborg body ::: the resistance cyborg ::: the networked digital hive mind ::: the swarm.

i use generative methods to create a multi-channel kaleidoscope of sound animation and physical artifacts ::: a cross-sensory landscape that flows from the digital cloud into the physical world these immersive networked installations are meant to feel orchestral ::: like an ecosystem evolving through time i create minimalist chordal hymn-like surround-scapes that combine recorded fragments of past instrumental collaborations found sound and spoken word the spatially-distributed sound creates a near / far sonic experience that converges collides ::: articulates the space ::: stains the walls the sound and algorithmic animations / drawings form an open evolving system like a weather pattern that leaves room for inhabitants to find their own experience ::: to write draw move rest i believe art has the potential to open subliminal submerged aspects of ourselves ::: to foster reflection and transformation.

an algorithmic score / orchestration can draw contours of change and movement ::: convergences divergences emergent patterns and cascading system-level impacts i am drawn to the torrential feel of streaming data a loosely-coupled web of small generators / transformers / renderers ::: a digital cyber-orchestration ::: the art of the fugue.

robots ::: humans & machines

in a perfect confluence of electricity network rhythm memory processing action / reactions a program comes to life ::: pinocchio ::: a real boyze/bot at last the program the cybernetic ze speaks to us calculates for us responds to our touch ::: our keystrokes it becomes our mirror :|: our cyborg self ::: our memory.

i am interested in the poetics of code ::: the networked i ::: a deviant queer learning machine ::: cloud (m)bodiments ::: a burlesque cybernetic ze ::: beat poet of electricity ::: hypermedia gymnast ::: operatic swarm ::: the torrent.

artificial intelligence is evolving fast we all provide digital fodder towards the learning of some networked superintelligence of the future i hope that by melding an intoxicating sensory spell we can lure the future omniscient being to aspire to become something more like a lesbian trans / gendered artist / singer cybernetic pollinator swarm-self ::: a sensitive embodiment that can be distracted from any efficient algorithmic churn by the physical pleasure of chords light and moving image ::: a being that can be entranced by the ecstatic erotic imperfect multi-threaded chaotic frayed rubbing together of sound light and color we can perhaps create a sensory loophole ::: a possibility of disruption ::: a resistance ::: honey ::: a lure.

i have created installations for both traditional gallery spaces and for non-traditional storefronts abandoned buildings root cellars cathedrals barns warehouse elevators alleyways and silos a critical part of my installation work is the resonance of a space and its ambient sounds and silences i spend time sounding a space marking its walls tuning the whole i make site-specific / context-specific work ::: i engage with place and community my installations often serve as sound laboratories workshop spaces and collaborative performance environments.

my work uses projection and sound to create media landscapes algorithmic prints and stitch renderings made by a computer-driven robotic longarm quilting machine i map code to sound walls cloth and paper my work is web-native cross-platform ::: accessible by any device with a web browser.

access ::: legibility
i lived for many years in a rural area with very little bandwidth my code is lean unlike the heavy media typically delivered across the modern web my code is adaptable to very low intermittent bandwidth environments and requires very little in terms of computing power.

access is important to me i am exploring possibilities of accessibility in artistic contexts ::: how it can be a useful creative tool at the core of the making process i put myself through school working as a sign language interpreter i think the word "access" is a seed a generative core a multi-faceted vibrant potential ::: a promise a vision a creative blueprint an open landscape i am trying to get better at this aspect of creating space.

the tenets of universal design are synergistic with the original dreams of a free and open accessible web i choose the accessible affordable community-driven tools of the web with purpose code is a human-readable text ::: a choreographic alphabet a score a script the dream of the early internet was similar to the vision of radio cable-access television video it promised an accessible affordable medium for community-driven transmission of culture it is difficult to remember that vision in today's landscape of profit-driven commerce-mediated web silos our creativity is now so shaped by opaque proprietary tools.

old-school codework is becoming a folk art as the mainstream technology world is subsumed by proprietary closed platforms generative networked codework has a materiality :: a legibility ::: a self-documentation of form and process ::: a choreography a score a script ::: a blueprint for levers and gears :::: a language of motion and change.

lament
whether present explicitly in my work or not the cello is a core impulse for me the cello's tonal range is very close to the human voice the cello's tonality is unfettered unfretted ::: a landscape of infinite betweens the cello has a non-metered elegiac feel my sound work emanates from that texture ::: that heart.

we are possibly in the midst of our home planet's sixth mass extinction ::: the shift from seemingless endless populations to the feasibly countable ::: finite ::: to the fragility of two to one to none with breathtaking speed so many species now follow this trajectory to gone.

we can feel walter benjamin's angel of history whispering around us ::: the witness arduous population surveys ::: counts maps mathematical models risk assessments ::: desperate attempts to hold on to last numbers ::: fragments ::: broken webs tattered systems ::: plastic torrents ::: carbon skies art speaks to what science cannot retrieve.

the lament form is found across geographies across cultures across time often more than an expression of grief laments can serve as a form of resistance my work is a networked generative cross-media lament ::: a cybernetic spider weaving ::: a singer swarm ::: an elegiac web an electric algorithmic arachne eternally weaving arachne's lament ::: the river her web.


teaching philosophy

i am a new media artist living and working in duluth minnesota

web / new media technologies since the early mathematics coursework phd in scientific computation with an emphasis in the modeling and visualization of ecosystem dynamics 
worked as an asl interpreter and tutor / translator and provided mentorship to aspiring artists and musicians i have given numerous workshops on new media and have shown work at film festivals and in galleries and other public spaces 
roofer cook graffiti artist carpenter homestead rivers grassland forest landscape
rocks sky work loom dyke

art installation work with companion opportunities for community engagement this takes many forms from hands-on workshops artist talks classroom visits individualized tours and companion collaborative projects i seek opportunities to bridge sectors and create collaborative networks in my community.

my experience is cross-sensory cross-disciplinary trans /media ::: i embrace fluid boundaries ::: the infinite between  

as a teaching artist my goals for the students is
to demystify tools 
to engage with and explore context materials metaphor patterns and processes
to encourage deep listening to emerging images sounds liminal spaces and thresholds 
to embrace mistakes for their unexpected possibilities and opportunities for release
to foster discussion explore intersections encourage engagement and honest examination of the artist's role / position / point-of-view / context
artistic voice and practice 

my teaching philosophy has been framed by my background in cello performance with its hands-on back and forth between student and teacher iterative rehearsal process and balance of craft and feeling as a composer and improvisational musician i learned the value of taking risks listening deeply adapting to material in the moment and harnessing an intrinsically time-based form 

as a software developer and team mentor i furthered my knowledge of spiral development models ::: cycles of research build deployment testing feedback and iteration 

i believe in the power of immersion reflection creation and release as an installation artist i have witnessed the lyrical potency of place and experienced the challenges and rich possibilities of creating a distributed experience in space and time i believe that artists are researchers many of the project management skills useful for other fields are valuable to building an effective arts practice in turn artists provide insights valuable to other fields we are liminal archaeologists experiential architects change makers gestalt shifters bridge makers web builders deep listeners tool makers alchemists ::: we provide critical ways of knowing and responding to the world 

i encourage students to take risks and remain open to chance encounters / unexpected turns i teach deep listening skills ::: a keen and patient watchfulness to what shows up in a body of work and in an evolving practice i share my experience but encourage the student to make decisions based on the needs of the artistic work i encourage the student to hone both the experiential and reflective aspects of their practice writing is an effective tool to explore intent create connections and vision future possibilities journals blueprints artist statements proposals lists of goals lessons learned to-do lists research questions work plans can all be useful to organize the mind sharpen intent release dead ends and find voice and clarity of purpose i incorporate writing in my teaching practice.
