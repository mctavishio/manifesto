my hands were made of
bone & pulsing sound
i was a red wagon
black crow / blue bottle

dark wings
beat 3 times
& then
a queer
suspension
darkness &
pin hole
illuminations
no landmarks
no compass
tracks roads
intersecting webs
rivers —
a rushing turbulence
a sinew & pulse
dark marrow
blood & barren plains
shadow rock & fire
an iron railing
& time
seas rise
boats capsize
swallow water
turn & drown
dark waves erase
the passage
down
there were lights above
unmoved
while lamps below
flickered & burned
vast & deep
broken glass
stitched into dark blankets
of sleep
rocks aged
cyclones circled
a bird's
slate eye

raven feathers splayed
across the indigo cloud
beast or loom or cliff
a spider scales glacial walls
a radio tower pierces the sky
clouds gather

dark & trembling storm
the boats were green blue red
pale sails
anchors heavy

ropes
slowly plumbing the depths
anyway there was a map
industry!
progress!
we had a plan
we had time on a spool
or wires on a spool
or a snake skin with a map
or a spoon
we had a shiny spoon
a wheel & fire
machines wheels talking wires
fire

& stairs winding up past clouds
stairwells & lights & vast landscapes
of asphalt
roofscape fire escape flashlight
a stairwell a window a street
fires below & stars

wings & dark mountain
shadow mountain — a cliff
perilously close
a breath a moth
an illuminated distance
a stillness before raging nights
wind gathering force
a spring a wheel
rain factory sleet factory
lightning on telephone wires
gripping the kite — a static suspension
the key aflame
wings beating
toward shore
distant gray lines
taut heart beat swift

3 birds
laughing
whose last laugh?
3 birds last bird coughing bird
anyway the factory was going well
conveyer belts burning rubber
tires pulling freight past trees & signs
& swamps
highways roads & concrete bridges
golden arches

infinite skies
couldn't just count them
or it would take a long time
an uncountable number of years
to count the layers
so many possible answers
so many ways to measure things
to count the objects
to list the objects

into clusters of light
staining
the surface of things
in a radiance
that made you
lose count
lose your grip
forget the citation
a transfiguration

but close
it was so hard in the beginning
rigging without motion
forced scraped awkward
but not a bird
not a long-necked bird
awkward but not beautiful
not twisting skyward
a flat failure — leaden
not grief
but a longing

i reached towards you
my heart leapt towards you

roaming in packs
searching out a stranger
alone & queer
to beat within an inch of his life
rites of manhood for the college set

coughing pretty boys
i walked the fluid line
between he & she
always queer
hey baby
i miss you

saxophones &
electrified
guitars
spilled from
summer open doors
flung windows
curl of smoke
rolling papers
lysergic dreams
i remember your eyes
green

the saxophone player
from the psych ward
stunned out of
his mind
on some
psychotropic
tranquilizer
& yet
slow sweet sound
breath & reeds
burnished metal
hands & breath
sweet poet
shuffling poet
i remember you
in morning
awkward groups
sun through
metal bars
your words
sweet
kind
deranged
bent winged angel

& you 4 stringed lantern
wooden heart
my bones
i remember you
in hot practice rooms
hours & hours
& then forsaken
lost & forsaken bicycle
i can't even say it
can't tell you
lonely streets
wooden boat through
skipped school
don't talk about it school
bully school
frayed pitch
rough raw broken
strange beautiful pitch
resinous pitch
horse hair wire
wood
pine blood pitch
cat gut & wire
pitch

you have to fail 13 times
before you see the ladder
& even then
you can't reach
the last rung

frayed rope
musical line split
& frayed
& filtered
through water
contrast color
filter blur echo
the canvas of
river & street

my hands were made of
ambiguity
geometry
a distance
a confluence
a mapless continuity
complicity & resistance
cluster of birds
pulse
a flux
atoms
carbon
dissipating
heat
or torch & ice
a glacier
drowning
in its own red sea
so difficult to utter
such grief

3 moons
skewed horizon
incoherence
near / far
unpinned
sound is like
a ragged line
stain of red
wash of ink
my hands were birds
no birds
my hands were rivers
no rivers
my hands were
bone & pulsing sound
a cacophony of horses
across blue sky
